The activity assay also showed reduced activation of p-coumaric acid which yields phenylnannolone C. \\nfirst BCC/PKS system in microbial biosynthesis\\nphn1 most likely involved in ethylmalonyl-CoA biosynthesis\\nAT1 predominantly accepts ethylmalonyl-CoA to give rise to phenylnannolone A. However, phenylnannolone B, which contains a methyl instead of an ethyl branch, was also isolated. this indicates that AT1 can also accept methylmalonyl-CoA. Phenylnannolone A, however, is the dominant metabolite thus suggesting a preference for ethylmalonyl-CoA (which is in agreement with the bioinformatic analysis)\\nThe TE releases the polyketide under pyrone ring formation which is uncommon for modular typ I PKS systems",
